### Application Features

- **`List the repositories of your API`**: You should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in your API with the fields **title**, **techs** and number of likes following the pattern `${repository.likes} likes`, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like one of the repositories retrieve by the API`**: You must be able to give a like to an item in your API through a button with the text **Like** and you must update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile by mutating the state of the application.

### Tests Specification

In each test, you have a brief description of what your application must do in order for the test suits pass.

If you have questions about what the tests are, and how to interpret them, take a look at **[our FAQ](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/faq-desafios).**

For this challenge we have the following tests:

- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must be able to add a like in one of the listed repositories by clicking on the 'Like' button and that update should be viewed on the screen.
